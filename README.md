# Happy Mother's Day!

Pretty much a copy of faahim's [happy birthday repository](https://github.com/faahim/happy-birthday). The instructions in his repository apply here, so just use those.

Note: Couldn't fork it because I already used his for another person. So I manually copied the code and just replaced everything with "happy mother's day" vibe.
